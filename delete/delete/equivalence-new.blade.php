			<h1 >COOPERATION IS DIFFERENT THAN ALTRUISM</h1>
		</div>
        <p>Imagine you and your friends doing something amazing together. You smile at each other, everyone of you is enjoying it. That feeling of mutual happiness and satisfaction out of a shared benefit is the sign you are in cooperation. </p>

<p>What we look for is not only a <b>“win-win”</b> dynamic: the mere advantageous results aren’t enough, we also look at the relational collective happiness derived by the act of doing something together. </p>

<p>In order to have that <b>mutual enjoyment,</b> two main equivalences have to be respected: an <b>equivalence of benefits,</b> that happens when you get as much as the other participants, and an <b>equivalence in the relations,</b> where your positive emotions are shared amongst the participants.</p>
