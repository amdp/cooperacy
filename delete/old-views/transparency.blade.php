  <p class="subheading transparency center space margin">TRUTH</p>
  <p class="base">Honesty is regarded as one of the most important values in many cultural contexts. Nevertheless, truth is difficult to say and difficult to receive: it should be communicated with the right words and the right attitude.</br>
  <p class="subheading transparency center space margin">BETRAYAL</p>
  <p class="base">When transparency ends, frauds, hoaxes or reticence are a good example of apparent reliable collaboration that in reality is driven only by selfishness. If you have nothing to hide, why not being transparent?
  <p class="subheading transparency center space margin">FORGIVENESS</p>
  <p class="base">Do we want to know the truth to <em>learn</em> and take account of it or we want to know it in order to punish others? Behind the exchange of truth there’s a great deal of acceptance. Most of us don’t say what they think just because they are afraid of the consequences. Only accepting the diversity of others we can know the reality behind the appearances. Being honest and transparent seems hard, but it is one of the ways in which you can change the world and your same personal life.</p>
