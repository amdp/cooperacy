It became a legal entity with one of the 8 researchers, the co-founder Ilario Tito, in
<span class="about"><b>2015</b></span>, after the first abstract of the model was accepted in the 2015 Collective
Intelligence Conference in Santa Clara organized by the Michigan University - Center
for the Study of Complex Systems in Ann Arbour. The event was part of the
institutional dissemination and confrontation activities fostered by the Centre for
Collective Intelligence in the <span class="about"><a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a></span> with the presence
of Facebook Research and the Vice President of <span class="about"><b>Google</b></span>, Regina Duncan.</p>
    <p>
The same year, Cooperacy has been chosen as part of the scientific lab of OuiShare, the leading organization for the Sharing Economy phenomenon, at the 2015 OuiShare Fest in Paris. The position of Cooperacy was supportive of cooperative economy, but against the <span class="about"><b>“sharing business”</b></span> activities.</p>

    During the following months the little organization has been invited in the first
International Conference on Positive Peace held by the <span class="about"><a href="http://economicsandpeace.org/">Institute for Economics and Peace</a></span>
at Stanford, but we were unfortunately too poor to participate and cover travel expenses.</p>
    <p>
We have been accepted and participated in the first International Association for the
Study of the Commons conference about <span class="about"><b>“The City as Commons”</b></span> in Bologna, and we’ve
been selected again in <span class="about"><b>2016</b></span> for the Collective Intelligence Conference at the Stern
School of Business in <span class="about"><b>New York.</b></span></p>

<p>
Before going to New York we flew to Taipei where we’ve been invited by Audrey Tang,
now minister of <span class="about"><b>innovation</b></span> and technologies in Taiwan, at the 2016 g0v conference.
</p>

<p>In the same 2016 we have been invited at the Hamburg Open Production conference in
Germany.</p>
