  <p class="subheading freedom center">COOPERATION IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT</p>
  <p class="base">Thinking in terms of cooperation and ecosystems enhances the understanding of complex organizations in order to respect their balance and foster their growth. Increased resilience, organisational capability and innovation can be achieved through ecosystemic thinking and internal cooperation.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading freedom center">A PROFITABLE PROFIT SEEKING</p>
  <p class="base">Profit seeking based only on performance will perform less and bring smaller profits. Cooperacy proposes an ecosystemic model for the management and the facilitation of meetings together with evaluations and interventions related to internal cooperation. The Cooperacy seven dimensions framework measures the Equivalence, Trust, Care, Transparency, Freedom, Understanding and Diversity levels for a in-depth interaction overview. Striking a balance between the different conditions enables new development and productivity in governments, companies and nonprofit organizations.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading freedom center">COOPERATION SCIENCE NARRATIVE AND APPLICATIONS</p>
  <p class="base">Cooperacy offers a set of narratives and applications able to foster internal cooperation and ecosystemic balance. Cohackathon is the more productive way to organise a hackaton for your goals. Open ecosystem is a narrative-based gamified open ecosystem that brings internal and external forces to collective solutions. Overview is a quantitative tool useful for focused ecosystemic interventions. Cooperation and ecosystemic thinking workshops may give the basic and advanced tools to think differently, in a more complex and interconnected way.</p><br>
