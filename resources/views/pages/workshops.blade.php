    <p class="subheading freedom center">TRAINING FOR DEVELOPMENT</p>
    <p class="base">Training human resources in cooperation and ecosystemic thinking makes managers and employees to develop new alternative skills able to better cope with complexity. This will allow them to develop long term solutions and avoid quick fixes and short term changes that will produce low performances in the future.</p><br>

    <p class="subheading freedom center">WHAT WE TEACH</p>
    <p class="base">The course could be customised according to the needs. The scientific side, more technical and specific, goes together with narratives and applications that simplify technical concepts. A definition of Cooperation, "cooperation feeling", egoism, altruism, linearity and complexity could be a first step, followed by the semantics of Cooperation and the main differences with other interactions. Evolutionary Biology and the many theories about the evolution of cooperation go together with the Neuroscience of Cooperation, the Diversity Theorem, Game Theory, Public Good game, and Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom approach to social dilemmas. An excursus into social networks, social ecosystems, innovative statistical tools and the Cooperation Context Index could be other technical components of the course.
    On a more applicative side, the Cooperation Diagram would be accompained with colors and attributes like Qualitative, Irrational, Dynamic, Emotive, Relational and their opposites. The expression of personal expectations and preferences will be compared in Non-violent communication and Desire communication. Other social technologies will be introduced like Open Space Technology, Open Ecosystems, the Journey Narratives, the Dunning-Kruger effect and the KÃ¼bler-Ross stages of grief. Circular, primitive and cooperative games, together with the cooperative monopoly, may show how to understand the cooperation dynamics may be even based on serious fun and entertainment.

    <p class="subheading freedom center">WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT</p>
    <p class="base">At the end of the course you would have acquired knowledge and tools to better understand other people's view and integrate your perspectives with theirs. Your comprehension of the systemic consequences of activities or changes in your organisation will be improved along with the ability to distinguish short term fixes from long term resilient solutions. You could finally transform this new awareness into interventions able to foster more internal cooperation and a shared understanding of the organisation social ecosystem.</p><br>
