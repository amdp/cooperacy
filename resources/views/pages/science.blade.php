              <p class="base">
              Humans live in a reality that is observed by the physics perspective and subsequent complex system approach. Being humans life forms, they are observed also by biology through genetic and natural selection dynamics. Furthermore, human consciousness allow self-observation with specific behavioral sciences, psychology, sociology, anthropology and etology. Human cooperation may show similarities with that of other animals, even if some eusocial behaviors may show important differences, like those found in the primatology field. As part of current society, they interact at a social level with economic and governance aspects that are also part of scientific investigations and simplified models like those of the game theory and agent-based modeling. Human languages semantics may contain hints of their communication processes, and be a prelude to the findings about cooperation at a philosophical level. Neuroscience may explain cooperation as an emergent complex phenomenon coming out from the interaction of basic rewards seeking. From the neuroscience of rewards, necessary to human survival, we can go back to evolutionary biological behaviors and to physics- and statistical mechanics-related elimination of local entropy.<br>
              Thus, when observing the human interaction called cooperation we start from a system approach that is investigated also with the help of all the above mentioned disciplines.<br><br>
              <p class="base">
              The Cooperation Science model proposed compares the results of these different disciplines. We are about to release the first edition of this investigation, that specifically combines a general framework with the mentioned semantic, evolutionary biology, game theory, and neuroscience based approaches. We would also like to provide a subsequent economic model for a social system based on cooperation science.
