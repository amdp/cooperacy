              Humans live in a reality that is observed by the physics discipline and subsequent complex system approach. Being humans life forms, they are observed by genetic and natural selection dynamics. After being part of the physical world and the evolutionary biological realm human awareness allow self-observation as animal group and individuals with their specific behavioral science, psychology, sociology, anthropology and etology. Human cooperation may show similarities with that of other animals, even if some eusocial behaviors may show interesting differences, due to the high level of awareness and sociality of humans, like those found by the primatology field. As part of current society, they interact at a social level with economic and governance aspect that are also part of scientific investigations and simplified models like those of the game theory. Human languages semantics may contain hints of their brain circuitry as well as their philosophy and neuroscientific processes may determine their identification of rewards, that allow us to go back to biological behaviors of survival and to physics- and statistical mechanics-related elimination of local entropy. Thus when observing the human interaction called cooperation we enter in a complex system that is investigated by all the previous cited disciplines.<br><br>
  <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH</p>
              The Cooperation Science model proposed compares the results of these different disciplines. We are about to release the first edition of this investigation, that specifically combines a general framework with the cited semantic approach, the evolutionary biological one, the game theoretical one, the neuroscientific one, the possible scientific verification of the model and a subsequent economic model for a social system based on cooperation science.
