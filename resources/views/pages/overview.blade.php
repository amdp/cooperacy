    <p class="subheading freedom center">CAN WE MEASURE COOPERATION?</p>
    <p class="base">Cooperacy Overview is a methodology that allows to measure the conditions of Cooperation in your organisation in order to obtain a complete overview of your social ecosystem. This would allow you to have a deeper understanding of your human resources interactions and how they could be improved in cooperation and ecosystemic terms.</p><br>

    <p class="subheading freedom center">CREATE YOUR OWN ORGANISATION INDEX</p>
    <p class="base">What could be the measure of Trust in your organization? What could measure the Freedom to innovate amongst your people? What about your organisation Transparency? This and other kind of indexes may be identified in your social ecosystem in order to overview what changes could drive to a more productive and growth-oriented balance between your departments.</p><br>

    <p class="subheading freedom center">POSSIBLE ECOSYSTEMIC INTERVENTIONS</p>
    <p class="base">Once the overview is completed, identifying the possible interventions becomes an easier task. Nevertheless, in order to apply the required changes, it is very important to respect the ecosystemic relations in order not to break their balances. The final step in the Cooperacy Overview methodology is therefore to schedule gradual transformations that may finally result in an organic evolution able to foster, together with the desired growth, mutual enjoyment in the human resources involved.</p><br>
