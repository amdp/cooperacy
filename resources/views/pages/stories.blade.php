  <p class="subheading freedom center space margin">STORIES</p>
  <p class="base">This page is dedicated to our stories, the ideas that came our from Cooperacy, and the projects we realized. You can join us and propose yours!</p>
<br>
  <p class="subheading freedom center space margin">COOPERATION SCIENCE</p>
  <p class="base">This project is the first and most important one as Cooperacy was born from our scientific research about Cooperation.<br><br></p>

  <p class="base">Alessandro Merletti De Palo and Ilario Tito were friends since 35 years. In 2014 they met in Rome, at the Peace Bar, to talk about how much the social system needed a change. A serious talking amongst friends, the typical chat that ends once you say goodbye. Instead, when Alessandro goes back home, he keeps on thinking about it. How do you call that special, enjoyable energy that you feel with your friends even when you do something useful? There was no specific emotion, but Alessandro thought about the word "cooperation". What is cooperation? Can we bring that emotion of doing things together with enjoyment at a worldwide level? He wanted to know more, but there was no "University of Cooperation". So he started with the simplest thing he could do. He looked for the word cooperation in the dictionary. There were many definitions, but none was clear. He started reading scientific articles about it, intertwining different disciplines. Game Theory, Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology, Economy, Evolutionary Biology, Linguistics, Anthropology, Neuroscience.. there were many different approaches to the study of cooperation. Merging them together in a model, Alessandro called Ilario back and asked him to cooperate together and find eventual demonstration of the theory, in order to to introduce it at the MIT Collective Intelligence conference. Together with Maria Gisa Masia, Alessandro Mancinella, Mariangela Nitti, and Kanwar Ujjawal Singh they wrote a paper that was accepted at the conference. Since then, they participated to many other conferences around the world: this story tells the start of the theory behind the idea of Cooperacy.

  <p class="subheading freedom center space margin">ACROYOGA COOPERACY</p>
  <p class="base">This project was led by Igor Carravetta and Carola Ravaschino in 2016.</p>

    <p class="base">During one of the first Cooperacy meetings, we were discussing how to test the voting system and to try to effectively do something together. Igor and Carola were doing Acroyoga at the time with a friend of them. They were telling how the courses were: acroyoga merges acrobatic movements with simple yoga positions, in a funny and enjoyable way as you do them at least in two. This means you need to learn to cooperate with your body movements, relying on the body of another person. It's a different cooperation compared to the standard actions we do together, this time the bodies balance depends on the reciprocal perception and understanding of the participants. It was a very good project to start with the testing, and Alessandro Merletti De Palo proposed to Carola and Igor to invest a very little sum to promote a course during the winter. The whole group voted and we had acroyoga sessions once a week, until March 2017. It was an amazing experience, we hope to start over again in October 2017!</p>
  <p class="subheading freedom center space margin">EXPERIMENTAL PROJECTS</p>
  <p class="base">This is a non-exaustive list of the projects we are currently investigating.<br />
  <div class="center"><img width="480px" height="360px" src="{{asset('/images/coofood.png')}}"><br><br></div>
  <span class="freedom">1.</span> We tested in Milan a system of buying fruits and vegetables from cheap sources and reselling them amongst the members. We did it around three times and we made an earning of 30 euros paying all other expenses.<br>
  <span class="freedom">2.</span> Always in Milan, we tested to get cheap, organic, multi-cereal bread from Busto Arsizio and we found out we could develop a business out of it.<br>
  <span class="freedom">3.</span> We organized the catering for an event, and we found out we can earn &#126;100 Euros for each event we organzie.<br>
