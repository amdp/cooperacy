  <br><p class="subheading freedom center space margin">THE PERSONAL ADVENTURE</p>
  <p class="base">The Journey is a personal adventure that flows through the conditions of cooperation realms. When you join Cooperacy you will have a personal mentor that will guide you though the Cooperation Journey and develop your cooperation skills. Together, you will follow the seven steps of the Apprentice Journey and learn together -your mentor is just a more experienced learner- the way for accomplishing a better cooperation awareness. Useful for understanding contexts and groups, to bring important changes and social ecosystemic balance, the cooperation knowledge is able to let you understand the importance of your role in an organization or a community together with that of others, in order to make all the social ecosystem grow for mutual benefit and multirelational balance.</p>

  <br><p class="subheading equivalence center space margin">THE ORGANIZATION ADVENTURE</p>
  <p class="base">The Journey is also a form of growth available for whole groups. In order to bring improvement and needed changes, Cooperacy provides a path that follows the seven conditions in order to bring what is currently still not available or present in the group or organisation social ecosystem. Some companies that have strong rational or pyramidal structures need more equivalence to foster innovation obtainable through services instead of leadership changes, some institutions need more diversity or freedom instead, to shake a little bit the recurring negative processes they face. Family and small groups vary and tend to have good trust but strange information and decision flows. The Journey follows the same personal path for learning the "cooperation way", with dedicated group methodologies that bring better coordination of the organization's diversities through establishing mutual understanding, resolving limitations, distributing information and (re)building trust.</p>

  <br><p class="subheading understanding center space margin">THE GROUP'S JOURNEY</p>
  <p class="base">The Cooperation Journey is based on the many relations we have within our social groups, even at a personal level. The Group's Journey is therefore one of the best adventure we can do to improve our personal selves and become aware of the surrounding social ecosystem: it will release tensions where we are damaging our possibility to enjoy our lives and objectives together, it will teach us to respect the different nuances everyone of us has, be it the family, the friends, the colleagues or the world's level, without renouncing to our personal respect and our intimate desires. At the end of the Journey a new awareness will bring fresh energy and new possibilities for the best of the personal, the social and even the natural ecosystem that surrounds us everyday.</p>
