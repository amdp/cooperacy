  <p class="subheading care center space">WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT COOPERACY?</p><br>
  <p class="base">Cooperacy is the project you should choose if you want to “change the world”. It may sound huge. It may seem impracticable. But it’s a simple consequence of the Cooperacy social system design and of the cooperative decision making methodologies.<br>When you choose with your friends, your job colleagues, your sport teammates you can do little improvements in the way you decide together that can, on a larger scale, change the world.<br>Moreover, participating in our collective fund that realizes the different ideas of the participants, without a centralized authority that chooses who to support and finance, is a big change, because you stop electing the people and you just choose the ideas.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading care center space">YOU WOULD EXPERIMENT A DIFFERENT DEMOCRACY</p><br>
  <p class="base">Cooperacy lets you learn how to decide together and resolve proportionally. Every position of a group is valid and is integrated. On a societal scale, people vote ideas instead of people. Voting a person to decide in your name on your community needs, policies and affairs means giving this person too much power. We see the result of this model all over the world. The democracies elect people that then don’t have a clear objective to realize and do what they please. This has to change. Voting projects instead of people is a different democracy, a Desing Democracy. Just this would generate an epochal change.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading care center space">YOU WOULD MAKE WARS BASED ON MONEY DISAPPEAR</p><br>
  <p class="base">Maybe not all the wars are based on money. Some say all wars are based on economic interests, but maybe it is not so. What we tend to see, nevertheless, is that most wars are based on economic interests. Learning how to decide together proportionally or to use a common fund and voting for projects in order to finance them may trigger the creation of a different governance and a different economy. <br>Your awareness of the decision making process in your groups will grow and you will understand its complexity.<br>On a wider level, the participant's common fund would grow and the money would be invested in projects without the possibility to be accumulated by single individuals. If the world would work this way, there would simply be no incentives to start a war. The few people who own more than half of the world’s wealth and rule through aggression and corporate control would start to change, not being anymore afraid of losing what they have collected due to conflict and death, but learning to share and be happier in a path of peace and life.

  <p class="subheading care center space">YOU WOULD MAKE MULTINATIONALS BECOME MULTILOCALS</p><br>
  <p class="base">What is a multilocal? Imagine a ring of small traditional shops that share the same accountant, the same legal, the same website and sell together online other than in their small town. Imagine small factories that produce goods together, sharing their knowledge and having a common balance. Imagine this big multinational with no central authority, no financial shares, just, again, a common fund and a governance based on ideas. It’s a company with a lot more diversity of products and resilience in the market: cooperative societies are way more resistant to market instability. You may like to save the old style shops that use healthy food, safe materials, traditional processes and avoid the standardization of the multinationals in their blind run for a growing profit. This is what the collective fund could be.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading care center space">YOU WOULD JOIN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND EMOTIONS</p><br>
  <p class="base">Are you afraid of artificial intelligence? Give it a heart. We plan to collect al the data from our projects and make the AI observe them. Big data analysis will be paired worh individual emotions too. Biofeedback sensors and IoT of emotions are the future tools with which we can understand collectively how artificial intelligence could influence the system in a way that makes us feel happy and loved.<br>We would have a world not based on productivity and surplus only, but on happiness and caring too.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading care center space">YOU WOULD PERFORM MORE IN THE JOB YOU DREAM OF</p><br>
  <p class="base">The current world needs the activity of everyone of us. A lot of economic indicators take into consideration productivity. But you know you would perform better if only they would let you do the job you dream of. Your motivation would simply boost your productivity.<br>This is why the Cooperacy social system is based on projects and commitment. Imagine the job world made of many, many projects. You’re just in the wrong one. Once you have a list of projects that may fit your desires, you may commit and be part of them since the beginning or join them while they’re ongoing. If none of them are available you may even start your own with other Cooperacy participants, and receive funding to develop your common project.</p><br>

  <p class="subheading care center space">YOU WOULD FEEL YOU’RE HEALING THE WORLD</p><br>
  <p class="base">The world has ecosystemic problems. Pollution, greed, energy savings and water. The system we live in is not working, it is evident and clear for everyone. Rioting and protesting does not seem to have changed anything radically. We need an evolution of the system, not a fighting revolution that will just harm the system more. You may want to learn how the decisions you make with other people around you may improve, be more effective and constitute a change, on bigger scale, for everyone.You may want to heal the world by developing sustainability projects through the Cooperacy fund, or helping others do it just keeping the fund active with your little one euro contribution.</p>

  <p class="base">All the above will make you feel you’re more.. You. Our souls experience a split personality because we live in a sick system that on one hand makes us happy and on the other makes us accomplices of effects we would never want: corporate control, bad politics, weapons market and wars. Imagine to change the current state of things with a slight difference in how you make decisions. Imagine to live together with your community without having to renounce to your personality, avoiding being different from.. yourself.</p><br>
