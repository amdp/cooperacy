              <p class="base">
              Cooperacy Research Association represents the scientific branch of Cooperacy, founded as an independent research group on the 23rd September 2014.<br><br>
              During 2014, a group of 7 independent researchers investigated from different disciplines and perspectives the model of Cooperation Science developed by Alessandro Merletti De Palo based on an extensive literature review about Cooperation and its many different frameworks.<br><br>
              The model was confirmed by the investigations results, and the subsequent paper was accepted at the M.I.T. 2015 Collective Intelligence Conference in Santa Clara, organized by the University of Michigan - Ann Arbour.<br><br>
              Starting 2015 it became  a legal entity with the official registration in Milan by the co-founder Ilario Tito in 2015.<br>
              <p class="subheading understanding center space margin">THE FRAMEWORK</p>
              The Cooperation Science framework has afterwards been presented in 2015 at the OuiShareFest, the leading worldwide event about the emerging phenomenon of the Sharing Economy, held in Paris. Afterwards our approach has been refined with semantic clusters for the IASC conference in Bologna organized by LabGov.<br>
              In 2016 Cooperacy has been invited in the first International Conference on Positive Peace held by the Institute for Economics and Peace at Stanford and presented the model at the g0v Conference in Taipei and in Germany, Hamburg, at the official Conference for Coproduction systems. Our preliminary Cooperation Context Index together with Facebook Group analysis were presented at the 2016 Collective Intelligence Conference at the New York Stern School of Business. <br>
              In June 2017 the CCI got accepted in Macao PLS-SEM conference where the updated index was disclosed. In September 2017 Cooperacy has been invited to hold two workshops at the Techfestival week in Copenhagen and to be part of the Cph150, a progressive 2-day think tank on the relationship between technologies and humans.<br>
              During that year, a group of 7 independent researchers investigated from different disciplines and perspectives the model of Cooperation Science developed by Alessandro Merletti De Palo based on an extensive literature review about Cooperation and its many different definitions. The model was preliminarily confirmed by investigations results, and the subsequent project paper was accepted at the M.I.T. 2015 Collective Intelligence Conference in Santa Clara, organized by the University of Michigan - Ann Arbour, with the presence of Facebook Research and Google vice-president.<br>
              "Cooperacy" then became a legal entity with the official registration in Milan by the co-founder Ilario Tito in 2015.
