              <p class="base">
              Cooperacy Research Association represents the scientific branch of Cooperacy, founded as an independent research group on the 23rd September 2014.<br><br>

              The research investigation questions what is Cooperation and what are its conditions, in order to understand how to coordinate human diversity towards mutual enjoyment and better ecosystemic awareness.<br>

              During 2014, a group of 7 independent researchers investigated from different disciplines and perspectives the model of Cooperation Science developed by Alessandro Merletti De Palo based on an extensive literature review about Cooperation and its many different frameworks.<br><br>
              The model, based on interdisciplinary systemic approach, was confirmed by the investigations results, and the subsequent paper was accepted at the M.I.T. 2015 Collective Intelligence Conference in Santa Clara, organized by the University of Michigan - Ann Arbour.<br><br>
              Since 2015 the Cooperacy group became the legal entity Cooperacy Research Association with the official registration in Milan together with the co-founder Ilario Tito.<br><br>
              <p class="base">The Cooperation Science framework has been presented in 2015 at the OuiShareFest, the leading worldwide event about the emerging phenomenon of the Sharing Economy, held in Paris. Afterwards our approach has been refined with semantic clusters and shown during the IASC conference in Bologna organized by LabGov.<br>
              In 2016 Cooperacy has been invited in the first International Conference on Positive Peace held by the Institute for Economics and Peace at Stanford and presented the model at the g0v Conference in Taipei as well as in Germany, Hamburg, at the official Conference for Coproduction systems. Our preliminary Cooperation Context Index together with Facebook Group Cooperation analysis were presented at the 2016 Collective Intelligence Conference at the New York Stern School of Business.<br>
              In June 2017 the Cooperation Context Index got accepted in Macao PLS-SEM conference where the updated index was disclosed. In September 2017 Cooperacy has been invited to hold two workshops at the Techfestival week in Copenhagen and to be part of the Cph150, a progressive 2-day think tank on the relationship between technologies and humans.<br>
